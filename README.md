# new-era-portfolio-page

The Porfolio of an Aspiring Web Developer

## Description

My motvation for this project was to be able to create a Porfolio landing page that would display projects and themes that display both my skillset and personality.
I wanted to build this to not only test my skills as an upcoming developer, but to be able to test limits and see different interactions between CSS and HTML.
This Project allowed me to find gaps in my knowledge such as interaction between parent and child objects, while at the same time giving a gallery of the things that I've learned and am learning.
